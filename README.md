# CSCI-5611-Project-4

By: Michael Cauthorn (cauth006), Jacob Malin (malin146)

## Update 11/30/2022:
We have made a rubrics-colored prison with collision detection and basic physics (jumping and gravity). We made a vec4 library and implemented an object (tree) spawning in specific w coordinates. We also added a UI bar to show where the user is in w space.
